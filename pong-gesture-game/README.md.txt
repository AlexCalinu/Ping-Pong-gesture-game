Known Issues & Limitations

Hand tracking accuracy may be affected by poor lighting or camera quality.

Hand-paddle assignments may occasionally be incorrect.

Performance depends on webcam quality and system specifications.

Ball speed increases significantly as the score increases, making the game too difficult.

The bonus ball may be hard to see depending on the selected theme.

Hand detection may fail in certain hand positions or when hands overlap.
